# Briefing Report

## Executive summary
This briefing synthesizes insights from two significant documents covering very different domains: classical military strategy and modern global health innovation. *The Art of War*, translated by Lionel Giles, is a foundational military text offering enduring principles of strategy and tactics that continue to influence military and leadership thinking. Giles’ scholarly translation elevated understanding by providing rich commentary and accurate interpretation, contributing to its wider recognition especially during the 20th century.

On the other hand, the WHO Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020-2025 presents a contemporary roadmap for integrating digital technologies into health systems worldwide. It advocates for countries to develop cohesive, evidence-based digital health strategies that promote equitable access and privacy protection, while leveraging new technologies to overcome health service challenges, especially in resource-limited settings.

Together, these documents highlight the evolution of strategic thinking from traditional warfare to modern public health, illustrating the universal value of strategic planning, adaptability, and the ethical application of advanced tools—whether in military conflicts or global health initiatives.

## Key takeaways
